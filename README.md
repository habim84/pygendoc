# pygendoc
## Description
This project's goal is to create a python tool that could auto-generate HTML files to display pydocs within your project. Similar implementation can be seen with the documentation generation for Intellij (Java). This tool is compatible with both python 2.7 and python 3.6 projects but it requires python 3.6 to run this tool.
## Motivation
When I was tasked to create java documentation for one of my assignments, I thought one of the requirements was to create a HTML documentation for my Java assignment project. Fortunately, I was using Intellij at the time and it included a feature to generate a clean HTML java documentation pages by using all the javadocs created within my java classes. We had some discussions if PyCharm included such feature and alas, we did not find such tool. Hence, I decided I could create some tool to help generate documentation for anyone to integrate with their python project. This makes it easier for people to generate html pages to be used in their github io pages for their tool under the same constant format. Furthermore, this encourages people to document their code frequently.
